## Graphics Card

The graphics card I use is an [ASUS RTX 4070 Dual](https://www.asus.com/de/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/dual/dual-rtx4070-o12g/). It will fit perfectly, but due to its size I created a fastener and I created a placeholder for the PCIe riser cable, otherwise it would be a bit crooked.

## Fastener

Use a temperature stable filament.
