## AIO

I can confirm that following All-in-One (AIO) water coolers will fit the case:

* [ASUS ROG Ryuo 120 (OLED)](https://rog.asus.com/cooling/cpu-liquid-coolers/rog-ryuo/rog-ryuo-120-model/)
* [ASUS ROG STRIX LC II 120 ARGB](https://rog.asus.com/cooling/cpu-liquid-coolers/rog-strix-lc/rog-strix-lc-ii-120-argb-model/)
* [ASUS TUF Gaming LC 120 ARGB](https://www.asus.com/de/motherboards-components/cooling/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-lc-120-argb/)

The OLED one is not recommended due to constant burn-in issues.

### Custom Tubing

The 380 mm long tubes are hard to install, so I replaced them with custom ones:

Replacement itself is a simple task, but filling the AIO without leaving to much air into it can be a hard. I do not recommend stiff tubes for this small case, as they tend to kink once the system gets warm. I therefore used the rubber-like TygonÂ® E-3603 with 6.4 mm inner and 9.6 outer diameter. This tube is also available with an outer diameter of 12.7 mm. It is tight even without zip ties.

I do **not recommend** using colors without prior testing. If they stain all your hard work is for nothing.

## Graphics Card

The graphics card I use is an [ASUS RTX 4070 Dual](https://www.asus.com/de/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/dual/dual-rtx4070-o12g/). It will fit perfectly, but due to its size and to secure it for transports I created a fastener and I created a placeholder for the PCIe riser cable, otherwise it would be a bit crooked.

### Fastener

Use a temperature stable filament.
